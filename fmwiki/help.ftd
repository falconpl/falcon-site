<h1>Falcon Micro Wiki</h1>

<h2>Paragraphs</h2>
<p>Just separate paragraphs with newlines.
A newline, a new paragraph. Easy enough</p>

<h2>Text effects</h2>
<p>Bold is performed surrouding sentences with "*", <pre>*like this*</pre> which
outputs "<b>like this</b>".</p>
<p>Emphasis (or <em>italic</em>), is done surrounding a sentence with "_".</p>
<p>Underline is done surrounding a sentence with "__".</p>

<h2>Lists</h2>
Starting a line with "#" creates ordered lists, while starting a line with
a "-" creates unordered lists. Multiple levels can be opened using more
than one "#" or "-" in a row, up to three. In example:

<pre>
   # first
   # second
   ## second and a bit
   # third

   - Item a
   - Item b
   -- Part of item b
   -- Part of item b too
   - Item c
</pre>

Will be rendered as:
<ol>
   <li>first</li>
   <li>second </li>
   <ol>
      <li> second and a bit </li>
   </ol>
   <li>third</li>
</ol>

<ul>
   <li> Item a</li>
   <li> Item b</li>
   <ul>
   <li> Part of item b</li>
   <li> Part of item b too</li>
   </ul>
   <li> Item c</li>
</ul>

<h2>Headings</h2>
Create headings (section) surrouding paragraphs with equal amounts
of "=". In example:
<pre>
=Main heading=

==Makes an h2==

===Makes an h3===
... and so on
</pre>


<h2>Internal links</h2>
<p>To link a page in the wiki, just surround a short page name (less than 80 chars)
in "[]" square brackets. An alternative description may be given separated with a
"|" pipe. In example:</p>
<pre>
   This line will contain a link to an [internal page].
   This [internal page|too].
</pre>

<p>The name of the page won't be automatically displayed in the final rendering,
so you don't have to use significative or display-friendly nouns.</p>

<p>If a page with the given name doesn't exist, the authenticated user will be given
a chance to create a new page; so to create a page, just make a new link to an internal
page and then follow it.</p>

<h2>External links</h2>
<p>To link an external site or a complete URL, use "[[]]" double square brakcets. Again,
a description of the link may be given adding a "|" pipe, like this:</p>
<pre>
A friend site: [[http://www.falconpl.org]].
Always [[http://www.falconpl.org|a friend site]].
</pre>

<h2>Escapes</h2>
<p>All the above special characters and sequences can be rendered to wiki
by just having them prefixed with a back slash "\". A sequence of two
backslashes will be rendered as a single back slash. In example:</p>
<pre>
To make a link, do \[like this|so\].
To write a WIN directory, do like this: *C:\\file\\path\\fname.exe*.
</pre>

<h2>Literals</h2>
<p>The sequence "^^" starts and ends a "preformatted" block; the pre-formatted
block is rendered via the "&lt;pre&gt;" HTML tag. Everything inside a pre-block
is parsed as usual, except for the fact that whitespaces and new-line are not
ignored.</p>

<p>The "^^^" sequence opens and closes a verbatim block. Verbatim parsing suspend
any kind of wiki parsing, including the escaping of special HTML characters. In
other words, this sequence allows also to send direct HTML codes.</p>

<p>In both blocks, the special sequence "\^" will just send a single "^", and
the double backslash "\\" will be parsed into a single backslash "\".</Ã¨>
