== Block formating

=== Headers

they start with one or more equal signs {{=}} followed by your title.

ie {{=== My beautiful header}} will render an {{h3}} HTML header.
 
=== Paragraphs

By default, they need a new line before and after them, but this can be fixed
to your needs.

A paragraph is just a container with some non-blank lines of text inside.
If you want to force a linebreak inside them, use {{\}} at the end of the line.
